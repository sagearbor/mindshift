# Decision: hysteresis on the ladder, WavLM+SpeechBrain as the cloud "heated" judge

*2026-09-20. Owner: "i think im good with your 1-4 suggestions, probably
including SpeechBrain." Evidence: `docs/research/2026-09-20-tone-model-options.md`,
`docs/plans/2026-09-19-heat-map-rounds.md`.*

## What was decided

1. **Hold-5s hysteresis on the loudness ladder.** The +6 dB first rung must
   hold for 5 consecutive 1 s windows before the ladder may escalate; reminders
   and decay unchanged. Measured dose: AMI 97 → 18/h, SBCSAE 80 → 12/h. 3 s is
   the fallback knob if the wrist feels sluggish. This is a three-runtime
   contract change (watch Kotlin `NudgePolicy`/`SentinelDetector`, phone
   `fastLoop.ts`, server `relay.py`) and must land in all three in one PR with
   the shared fixture updated.
2. **Flip Cloud Run `MINDSHIFT_TONE_AUDIO` from `off` to `dark`.** Logs
   arousal/valence/dominance beside every relayed session; no user-visible
   change. **Prerequisite:** bake the pinned 1.27 GB snapshot into the
   `INSTALL_VOICE=1` image layer (or GCS mount) so cold starts do not
   re-download it.
3. **Cloud "heated" judge on the relayed lane: WavLM odyssey_dim + SpeechBrain
   IEMOCAP.** Extend the PR #186 veto from valence-only to an arousal+valence
   confirm/veto within ~3 s of the instant tap. Stack AUC 0.941 / recall 0.66
   vs 0.897 / 0.59 for WavLM alone; +360 MB, +~100 ms. Gate: CONFER agreement
   must stay ≥ +0.55 and AMI/SBCSAE dose must not rise.
4. **On-device tier later:** eGeMAPS linear model (AUC 0.83, 36 ms) on the
   phone; distil our own Wav2Small-class student (MIT/Apache teachers only)
   for the watch. Published Wav2Small weights do not exist and are NC-licensed.

## Not decided / owner's call

- Streaming watch audio to the cloud when no phone is present (privacy posture).
- $50 OpenAI top-up to bench gpt-audio as a labeller (~$25 for a full bench).

## Order of work

1 (dose win, zero model risk) → 2 (data starts flowing) → 3 (quality) → 4.
Each step is verified from files: replay report + jest/pytest gate, never the
owner (`verify-from-files-never-owner`).
